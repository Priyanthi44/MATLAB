==Signal based/Data Driven Fault Detection System==

DC motor model is created using simulink
Real time output is processed using function
- Normalisation
- Detector Generation 
---output values at abnormal conditions from the output block
---display the structure at the terminate block ??real time display??
Output is visualised using scope
Normal data can be trained by running the the Solver Configuration at a stready state
Faults can be simulated by changing Solver Configuration etc.

TODO
-Program normatisation function in the block
-Improve algorithm and place in the block
-Display output
-Simulate errors
