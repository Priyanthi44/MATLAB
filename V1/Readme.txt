-The developed program uses one dimensional vector and the detectors are moved left or right (+/-)
-the distance is manhatton distance

Observations 

- When the decay rate is high, eta gets to a constant value
-When the number of observations are high , detectors didn't seem to move
-threshold plays a major role in moving the detectors 

Next version 

-TODO moving away from the detectors 
-TODO magic(4) more dimentional data
-rcb distance 
-read through the exsiting literature 
-Normalise to [0,1]
-Volume of self space
